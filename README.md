# rMathModeling

# [Under development. Testing and modificaiton being planned]

## Overview

This package is designed to manipulate general models.

Processes to crunch a problem with models are summarized to 3 groups:

 - Optimization models
 - Dynamic models
 - Probability models

From the structure introduced by the book Mathmatical Modeling 4th Ed. written by M. Meerschaert.

This package is coded from the code to work  through problems in the book. And  the functions and data structure can be
easily reused to work on more general modeling tools.

You may call these functions to build individual models, or wrap them up to manage systems with multiple models.

## Installation and a quick start

A copy of R is needed to run the package. You can get a local version from
https://www.r-project.org/
An IDE (e.g. Rstudio, Microsoft Visual Studio, Atom ...)is recommended/

To install, use 
```
install.packages('devtools')# skip this if you already have devtools
devtools:: install_github('HaoLi111/rMathModeling')
```

Type this to start up. 3 groups of functions, optim_, dynam_, and probs_ will be introduced.
The use of ply_ will be introduced on the way.
```
library(rMathModeling)
```
